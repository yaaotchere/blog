I finally Git It! I finally have a grasp on using Git from the command line and that it huge for me! I used to be so afraid of the command line and I thought it was too hardcore for me. It totally isn't too hard core for me. I am really enjoying my Oh My ZSH setup and have really given it an honest go. Z tab is my new fave!
