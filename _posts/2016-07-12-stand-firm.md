"I liked the other page more." In this case, the other page was a landing page, not a full wesbite.

Is it completely doucherific of me to say that I am not concerned about people liking things? What were the business goals that were outlined? Liking it wasn't a business goal. Fulfilling a business goal is not about the preference or taste of the person who owns the site. I can't fulfill a business goal on opinion. You are a photographer? You need bold images in order for people to start sharing your portfolio. If you would rather have the (frankly awesome) moody gray landing page - sure. I will keep a copy for you. But your users will not care. They will peace out and it ain't worth it. 

That was outrageously satisfying.

I love what I do and I appreciate so much that my clients have their all invested into a site going well. But I can't even begn to start schooling someone on photography because I know zero things about photography. I can't understand tricky things like apertures or f-stops (is that even a photography thing?) so I don't make recos based on that. Can you see the parallels with web design?
