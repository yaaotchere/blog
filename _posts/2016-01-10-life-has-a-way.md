Life has a way of getting moving at it's own pace. 2016 is only 10 days old and I have had so many different things come up. I'm meeting them with arms as open as I can and I look forward to what this year will bring. I am launching a small business, attending school and taking on greater financial responsibilities this year. It is a big year for me and I hope to make the most of it.

I'm tackling web development and programming with gusto and can't wait to see how far I can push myself. I have decided to spend January and February learning JavaScript and March and April flexing my Objective-C chops. Not to mention the 4 month long WordPress course I am enrolled in. 

2016 is the year I need to pull myself together and make my life what I want it to be. It's an overwhelming prospect but I am taking it one day at a time.
