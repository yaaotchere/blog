# What I'm Reading
I've always got my nose in a book, that has always ALWAYS been the case. I read for pleasure, for learning, for fun. All of it. I am currently reading _Git for Humans by David Demaree_ and it is pretty solid and easy to understand. I had a sweet project going and all was well and I kept saying, I will learn Git when I am done this. Famous last words eh? I managed to corrupt my work just then. I was not impressed. Luckily for me I have Back Blaze and I could recover a version that was a couple hours old but really, I could have just learned some version control before all that. So since I can't back in time I am gonna help future me and Git on with Git. See what I did there?
