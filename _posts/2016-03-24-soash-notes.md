# Secrets of a Side Hustla
The conversation started with a panel chat where this chick who works at Google (*holy shit so cool, can I be her?*) and this awesome chick who has a stoppable apartment which is exactly what it sounds like. It’s an apartment where people can come by, pick something up and buy it and go home. She was so cool! Her style played me. Any way, enough **fangirling,** onto business.

## The Meat and Potatoes
This section will have all the notes plus all my little tangent thoughts that happened while I was sitting there.

## How to find the “thing” you oughta be doing
- You gotta blend the what are you good at with what are you passionate about?
 - It helps to be solving a problem of some kind
 - Start with where you are and with what you can do
- A job is a job, it can fund your side hustle, it can give you the money to do it well
 - Try to reframe I hate my job to this is the thing that gives me the money and stability to pursue my side hustle and like no money = no supplies
 - If your job is draining your life force make sure you have a passion outlet of some kind
 - Be careful though! A side hustle might be so fun and so passionate and so much “better” than your job… that you lose focus at work. You still gotta work because… bills
- You need to learn how to let go and relinquish control and perfectionism
 - It holds you back from actually executing
- Ask yourself the tough stuff and really dig deep
 - What am I scared off?
  - Why?
  - What is the real reason?
  - Why? Keep asking why you are scared and face it head on
  - What is the worst that could happen?
   - Is it realistic? Probably not
- Get mentors and keep their counsel, but they can sometimes be smaller than your ideas
- Think huge! Think big!
 - If what you are doing doesn't scare you, you aren't doing the right thing (*I am not sure I believe or agree with that. Fear is a terrible motivator - in my experience. Maybe it needs to be, if something isn't challenging you*)
 - If your job right now burns your soul, get a better one. It doesn't have to be "THE DREAM Inc" but better is okay. Cuz you don't need to die/kill yourself/hate yourself whilt you side hustle. Get a job in a similar industry as the one you want to move into (For you Eirene, don't not apply to things because it is only "dog collars" ahem. For Yaa, apply to that god damn WordPress job already!)
 - think of you job as your Angel Investor, it is funding your side hustle
- Assess what at your job is fucking up your side hustle and change it/address it/do something about it
- DO SELF CARE!
- don't look to the future to be excited, be excited NOW! Find that in your day to day
- say YES to opportunity (Eirene -> maker fest | Yaa -> apply to jobs that are YOU (WordPress and Digital Consultant @Nutrionist))
- STOP OBSESSING AND STOP AIMING FOR PERFECT AND JUST FUCKING DO IT
 - Yaa: Seriously, put up that site. Fuckit
 - Eireme: Seriously, pick a name, sell your stuff for at least TWICE what you think (Ask Yaa first 🤗)
