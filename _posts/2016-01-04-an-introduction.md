I'm Yaa! I'm a front-end developer based out of Toronto.

I have always been interested in blogging and had all sorts of accounts on the usual suspects. I' talking blogger, blogspot and of course, Live Journal. Now that I am a front end developer I think it is fitting for me to move my blog onto a more hackerific platform. This is where Jekyll comes in. I have been making the concerted effort to get comfortable with the command line and I have been making the effort to write more. Using Jekyll for my blog is a great way for me to jion the two. 

I am going to keep exploring Jekyll and will make my next little project focus on making this site look the way I want it to look. Loud colours ahoy! I really want to have my blog and my personal site look like siblings, so it will be very fun making the needed changes on here.

I am diving into learning Ojective-C on my own and earning my front-end chops at HackerYou part time.

I think another post will have to serve as a personal primer into me.
