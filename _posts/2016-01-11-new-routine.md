I am trying to take the reigns on my daily routine and it is going along well. Today I got up before 7 and I'm listening to a great podcast while I work on relaunching my website. I need to eat some breakfast, that is for sure and get some exercise in as well. I really need to be sure to build up some good habits in order to take care of myself. That is the goal of 2016. Take care of myself.
